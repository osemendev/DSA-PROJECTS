# Amazon Product Review Analysis
This project is part of my DSA Data Analysis Capstone. I performed a full EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
on a dataset of amazon products, prices, discounts, ratings and reviews. This EDA is done in order to provide a structured analysis and visual
representation of reviews and to make calculated analysis.

 ## Insights
 #### Ratings
 - 929 products had ratings between 4-1-5.0. This shows positive review by customers for over 64.74% of products. A trend between positive feeback and aggressive discounting.
 - On the main excel file, a slicer attached to the ratings analysis shows the rate at which categories affect rating range.
 - below, a link to access the excel file containing my dashboard, pivot tables, cleaned table and original data directly has been attached.

#### Pricings
- This shows the breakdown of the average actual price of products in a category and also the average of discounted price of products in each category with respect to the discount range.
- The total average discount given for products with over 50% discount is less than that of products with less than 50% discount. This shows that percentage of discount given depended on quality, demand and price of the products as products higher than #500 had more discount rates of less than 50%.

  #### Category
  The top three products according to rating count.The category of electronics had more rating counts than the other categories. With a total of 15,778,848 rating count and an average of 4 ratings per product, electronics category is the best sold according to customer review data.

#### More Details
- Below is a screenshot of the pivot tables i created during the course of analysing this data and also, the dashboard in pdf format. It felt a bit tough at first but after understanding what was expected of me, I jumped into work mode. The data visualisation was a part I enjoyed so much because I love visuals.
- This is my first ever data analysis project and I am happy to have been able to achieve this all thanks to the incubator hub for the opportunity to learn.
- Thank you,DSA. Thank you, the incubator hub.
