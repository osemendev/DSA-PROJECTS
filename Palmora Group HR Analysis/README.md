> These findings suggest the need for region-specific salary audits and standardization of pay practices.

### Salary Band

- A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay 
employees a minimum of $90,000
- According to the bar chart in this visual, Only 292 employees in this company receive a minimum of $90,000 as salary. 
- 654 employees are still below this threshold and this shows that the company does not meet the requirements for this new regulation.
> **Only 31% of empolyees receives minimum salary of $90,000.**
