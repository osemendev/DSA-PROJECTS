##  Insights Summary

### Gender Pay Gap

- Female employees earn **3.5% less** than males on average across the organization.
- **Kaduna region** shows multiple reverse gender pay gaps, notably **-52.1%** in Engineering.
- **Human Resources in Abuja** has the **highest male-favoring pay gap** at **25.1%**.
- Departments like **Marketing & Engineering** show inconsistent equity across regions.
- **Sales and Support** departments maintain relatively **balanced compensation** across all locations.

> These findings suggest the need for region-specific salary audits and standardization of pay practices.

### Salary Band

- A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay 
employees a minimum of $90,000
- According to the bar chart in this visual, Only 292 employees in this company receive a minimum of $90,000 as salary. 
- 654 employees are still below this threshold and this shows that the company does not meet the requirements for this new regulation.
> **Only 31% of empolyees receives minimum salary of $90,000.**


### Salary Distribution by Minimum Threshold
- Three regions; Abuja,, Kaduna and Lagos are distributed based on their salary band. 
- Kaduna State is the state with the highest number of employees receiving a minimum of $90,000. The 111 employees is a 12.6% gap from the 97 employees receiving the minimum threshold in Abuja and a 24.3% gap from the 84 employees receiving the minimum threshold in Lagos.
